			<h2>fMRI</h2>
			<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging detects changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neural activity â€“ when a brain area is more active it consumes more oxygen.</p>

			<h2>MEG</h2>
			<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures changes in magnetic fields on the surface of the scalp. Magnetic fields are produced by changes in neural activity, which activate pyramidal cells of the cortex.</p>

			<h2>PET</h2>
			<p>Positron emission tomography (PET) involves injecting a radioactive substance in the carotid artery because it is similar to glucose, which is absorbed by active regions in the brain.</p>
