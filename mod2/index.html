			<h2>fMRI</h2>
			<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI detects changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neural activity â€“ when a brain area is more active it consumes more oxygen and to meet this increased demand blood flow increases to the active area. fMRI can be used to produce activation maps showing which parts of the brain are involved in a particular mental process.</p>

			<h2>MEG</h2>
			<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures changes in magnetic fields on the surface of the scalp. Unlike the fMRI, magnetic fields are produced by changes in neural activity, which activate pyramidal cells of the cortex. Neural activity is not affected by magnetic fields.</p>

			<h2>PET</h2>
			<p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is a bit more controversial than some of the other scans because it involves injecting a radioactive substance. Specifically, 2-deoxyglucose is injected in the carotid artery. This substance is used because of its similarity to glucose, a quality which neurons like very much. Neurons take 2-DG into their system, but cannot metobolise it. The result accumulates in active regions of the brain resulting in measurable levels of radioactivity.</p>
